Underground Jungle is a mod that adds an underground jungle biome and an underground jungle temple.

## About

Underground Jungle adds an underground jungle biome and an underground jungle temple inspired by the one in Terraria
that contains new blocks, two new mobs and a new set of tools that can be found inside the temple.

The underground jungle biomes tends to generate below jungles and dark forests, but might generate under other biomes
as well. The biome consists in patches of mud and jungle grass, a lush green grass that can spread to mud blocks.

The temple is a rare structure full of traps found in the underground jungle. Every temple has a treasure chest and a
temple key that you need to open the treasure chest. The treasure chest will contain one tool from the temple set.
These tools can mine every block in the vanilla game and are faster than any vanilla tool.

Jungle zombies can spawn in the underground jungle biome and mossy skeletons can spawn inside the temple. Both these
mobs can inflict the poison effect to players if they are hit.
